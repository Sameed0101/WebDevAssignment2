      <h3>These Are Some of My Favourite Tourism Spots:</h3>
      &nbsp;
      <h4>Maldives:</h4>
      &nbsp;
      <img src="/images/maldives.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Maldives officially the Republic of Maldives is an archipelagic
        state in South Asia, situated in the Indian Ocean. It lies southwest of
        Sri Lanka and India, about 750 kilometres (470 miles; 400 nautical
        miles) from the Asian continent's mainland. The Maldives' chain of 26
        atolls stretches across the equator from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the
        north to Addu Atoll in the south. Comprising a territory spanning
        roughly 90,000 square kilometres (35,000 sq mi) including the sea, land
        area of all the islands comprises 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), the
        Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed sovereign
        states and the smallest Asian country as well as one of the smallest
        Muslim-majority countries by land area and, with around 557,751
        inhabitants, the 2nd least populous country in Asia. Malé is the capital
        and the most populated city, traditionally called the "King's Island"
        where the ancient royal dynasties ruled for its central location.

      <h4>Mount Fuji:</h4>
      <img src="/images/fuji.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Mount Fuji located on the island of Honshū, is the highest mountain in
        Japan, with a summit elevation of 3,776.24 m (12,389 ft 3 in). It is the
        second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci
        on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on
        Earth. Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707
        to 1708. The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo
        and is visible from there on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally
        symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the
        year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently
        depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers,
        hikers and mountain climbers. Mount Fuji is one of Japan's "Three Holy
        Mountains" along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a Special Place
        of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites. It was added to the
        World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013. According to
        UNESCO, Mount Fuji has "inspired artists and poets and been the object
        of pilgrimage for centuries". UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural
        interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the
        mountain and the Shinto shrine, Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha.

      <h4>Fairy Meadows:</h4>
      <img src="/images/fairymeadows.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        Fairy Meadows named by German climbers (German Märchenwiese, “fairy tale
        meadows”) and locally known as Joot, is a grassland near one of the base
        camp sites of the Nanga Parbat, located in Diamer District,
        Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. At an altitude of about 3,300 metres (10,800
        ft) above sea level, it serves as the launching point for trekkers
        summiting on the Rakhiot face of the Nanga Parbat. In 1995, the
        Government of Pakistan declared Fairy Meadows a National Park
      </p>

      <h4>The Dubai Fountain:</h4>
      <img src="/images/dubaifountain.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Dubai Fountain is a choreographed fountain system located on the 12
        hectare (30 acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake, at the center of the
        Downtown Dubai development in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It was
        designed by WET Design, a California-based company also responsible for
        the fountains at the Bellagio Hotel Lake in Las Vegas. Illuminated by
        6,600 lights and 50 colored projectors, it is 275 m (902 ft) long and
        shoots water up to 500 ft (152.4 m) into the air accompanied by a range
        of classical to contemporary Arabic and world music. It was built at a
        cost of AED 800 million (USD $218 million). The name of the fountain was
        chosen after a contest organized by the developer Emaar Properties, the
        result of which was announced on 26 October 2008. Testing of the
        fountain began in February 2009, and the fountain was officially
        inaugurated on 8 May 2009 along with the official opening ceremony of
        The Dubai Mall.

      <h4>Brandenburg Gate:</h4>
      <img src="/images/gate.webp" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Brandenburg Gate is an 18th-century neoclassical monument in Berlin,
        built on the orders of Prussian king Frederick William II after
        restoring the Orangist power by suppressing the Dutch popular unrest.
        One of the best-known landmarks of Germany, it was built on the site of
        a former city gate that marked the start of the road from Berlin to the
        town of Brandenburg an der Havel, which used to be the capital of the
        Margraviate of Brandenburg. It is located in the western part of the
        city centre of Berlin within Mitte, at the junction of Unter den Linden
        and Ebertstraße, immediately west of the Pariser Platz. One block to the
        north stands the Reichstag building, which houses the German parliament
        (Bundestag). The gate is the monumental entry to Unter den Linden, a
        boulevard of linden trees which led directly to the royal City Palace of
        the Prussian monarchs.
